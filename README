Kernel for Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite/Goyave3g

Original kernel provided by Samsung on https://opensource.samsung.com/uploadSearch?searchValue=t116
Handpicked and applied all of the patches from the postmarketos "goyavewifi" testing build. https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/tree/master/device/testing/linux-samsung-goyavewifi

I have tried the goyavewifi testing build on my goyave3g, it boots with the same bugs as this kernel but the goyavewifi testing builds freezes after some time, in my experience this does not happen this kernel. 
Goyavewifi and Goyave3g are nearly identical devices so you may use this kernel for goyavewifi i believe(!!NOT TESTED!!). 

Postmarketos successfully builds and boots with the following errors:
-xfce4 interface does not start on boot. But may be started over ssh with startxfce4 command.
-lxqt does start on boot but battery is bugged.
-Both xfce4 and lxqt fails to align the touchscreen. But instead of aligning the touchscreen, display can be rotated to horizontal  to match the touchscreen. Look at the issue over here: https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/issues/1883
-Internal storage is not mounted and only ~300 mb of space is available.
